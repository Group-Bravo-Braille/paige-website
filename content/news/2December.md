# Paige Connect is now compatible with your favourite braille tools!

It's been an exciting three months, and we're thrilled to bring you the latest updates on Paige Connect. Here's a recap of our recent progress and the exciting news we've been waiting to share.

**Progress**
 
We are thrilled to share our recent achievements with you. In the UK, we successfully conducted trials with four local authorities, providing valuable support to students across multiple schools. The feedback we received has been overwhelmingly positive, prompting us to streamline our setup process and enhance the design for a more robust experience. As a result of these trials, our waitlist has seen remarkable growth.
 
Furthermore, our translation software has expanded to include even more languages, providing a broader and more inclusive experience for users. You can explore these new features using your keyboard [here](https://paigebraille.com/translate). We're also delighted to share that Paige Connect is now compatible with popular braille tools, including UEB Online, UEB Math Tutorial, and Duxbury. Discover more about these updates [in our video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_vp-dM3E-Q).

**Thank You**
 
We are immensely grateful for the support we have received over the past 12 months from the [Royal Academy of Engineering](https://enterprisehub.raeng.org.uk/enterprise-fellowships) through the RAEng 1851 Royal Commission Enterprise Fellowship. This program specifically backs innovative and creative entrepreneurial graduate engineers, and their support has been instrumental in our progress. Without the Fellowship, the Paige team wouldn't be where we are today.

We would also like to thank Ã“ran O'Neill from the Blind Guys Chat for interviewing us during Sight Village London. You can listen to the podcast where we share some insights about Paige Connect [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/bgc-bites-sight-village-part-4/id1532111653?i=1000640658643).
