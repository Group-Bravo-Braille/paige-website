# We are sending out our first Paige Connect boards to local offers and charities

It's been an exciting three months, and we're thrilled to bring you the latest updates on Paige Connect â€“ a revolutionary tool to learn braille explained [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnK82sIc45Q). Here's a recap of our recent progress and the exciting news we've been waiting to share.

**Progress**

We are thrilled to announce that we are sending out our first Paige Connect boards to local offers and charities. These organisation will be working closely with students and teachers, integrating Paige Connect into their learning environments for the remainder of this year. These trials will provide a valuable opportunity for real-world testing and gathering essential insights to perfect Paige Connect.

We are also excited to announce that we will be showcasing Paige Connect at Sight Village South-East on the 7th of November! We'd love for you to join us there. It's a great opportunity to see the product in action and have a chat with us. This is the first Sight Village we are attending as exhibitors and is happening near Imperial College London, where our team first met and created Paige! If you cannot attend for any reason, please book an online demo with us here.

**Thank you**

We recently had the privilege of presenting Paige Connect to the VI Tech Network. The response from Qualified Teachers of the Visually Impaired (QTVIs) has been outstanding. In fact, the response has been so overwhelming we are now faced with a wonderful challenge: we have more requests for trialling Paige Connect than we initially anticipated.
