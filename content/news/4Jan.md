# Hello, we are Paige!

We are excited to share with you the progress we made in the past month and the developments we have in store for you.

**Meet the team**

Paige was founded by a group of five Imperial College London engineers alongside braille experts and advocates trying to understand the difficulties blind and partially sighted people face when accessing braille. We are building Paige Connect, an affordable upgrade for existing braille writers.

Paige Connect is a small device that attaches underneath the braille writer and allows it to connect to a phone, tablet, or laptop. Once connected, the braille writer can be used as a keyboard, enabling users to type braille into a web app. The web app also includes software that translates braille into print for collaboration with sighted peers, parents, and teachers.

**Progress**

This month we launched our website, socials and newsletter on World Braille Day. The United Nations (UN) decided to proclaim the 4th of January as World Braille Day, to raise awareness of the importance of braille as a means of communication. Subscribe to our newsletter to get regular updates!

**Thank you**

We are proud to announce that we have received a Young Innovators Award from Innovate UK which will support us over the next year. Innovate UK is the UK’s innovation agency, and the Young Innovators programme nurtures the innovators of tomorrow to help tackle some of society’s most significant challenges.
