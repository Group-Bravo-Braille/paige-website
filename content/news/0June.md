# We have designed Paige Connect to support four areas of the curriculum framework for children with vision impairment (CFVI).

We are excited to share with you the progress we made in the past month and the developments we have in store for you.

**Meet the team**

We are thrilled to spotlight one of our valued team members, Sergio Gosalvez. Sergio works on day-to-day operations preparing for the launch of our first product, Paige Connect. This involves making sure that from the moment Paige Connect is manufactured to the moment it arrives through a customer’s letter box they are supported throughout the whole journey. This includes coordinating the design of our website, packaging, user manual and outreach to make sure we reach everyone who could benefit from easier braille learning.

**Progress**

While testing Paige Connect, we have been blown away by the positive response from qualified teachers of children with vision impairment (QTVI’s). To help serve QTVI’s in their vital role, we have designed Paige Connect to support four areas of the curriculum framework for children with vision impairment (CFVI):

Communication:  

Paige Connect translates braille into print so that children and young people can develop their social communication skills.

Literacy:  

Paige Connect retrofits to braille writers so that children and young people can develop literacy skills. 

Accessing Information:  

Paige Connect creates braille files so that children and young people can access, produce, and manage information independently. 

Technology:  

Paige Connect can be navigated with a screen reader so that children and young people can use technology with as much independence as possible.

**Thank you**

We are thrilled to announce that Sergio will be taking part in the Big Education Challenge created by the Big Change Charitable Trust to transform education and learning in the UK. This program supports young people seeking innovative ways to create a more inclusive education system that allows every child to thrive and enjoy success.
