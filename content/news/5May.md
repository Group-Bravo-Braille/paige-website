# Paige Connect is getting ready for CE and UKCA marking.

We are excited to share with you the progress we made in the past month and the developments we have in store for you.

**Progress**

We have officially entered the testing phase for Paige Connect in preparation for CE and UKCA marking. Our goal is to ensure that Paige Connect meets the necessary standards and regulations to provide you with a reliable and high-quality product.

This month we visited a test laboratory to assess whether the device operates within the acceptable limits, is safe to use and provides a reliable user experience. Safety is of the utmost importance to us, and our team is now meticulously reviewing the results and addressing any areas that require further refinement.

**Thank you**

We would like to express our gratitude for your continued support and patience throughout this testing phase. Your enthusiasm and trust in Paige Connect motivates us to work diligently to provide you with an exceptional product that meets your expectations.

In the coming weeks, we will be sharing more detailed updates on the testing progress, and you will be the first to know when Paige Connect launches. Thank you for being a part of our journey to make braille technology more accessible and inclusive.
