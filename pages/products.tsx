              Braille writers are mechanical devices that have been used for
              over 70 years to create braille. While they remain reliable, we
              want to modernise this iconic braille tool. We are building Paige
              Connect, an affordable upgrade for existing braille writers.

              Paige Connect is a small device that attaches underneath the
              braille writer and allows it to connect to a phone, tablet, or
              laptop. Once connected, the braille writer can be used as a
              keyboard, enabling users to type braille into a web app. The web
              app also includes software that translates braille into print for
              collaboration with sighted peers, parents, and teachers.
